# Android-User-Log-In-User-interface
This is  a very simple user login by using Glide libray.
I am here using animation. More specifically I am using gif images.  
The gif image quality may poor but u can easly replace it from @drawable folder.
replace the gif images accordingly your high quality gif images. the mechanism is same. Enjoy.
